1) Just pull the code in your Visual Studio Code.
2) Create a folder named audio as I have used it in the code and put 5 songs in it and name them as "song1", "song2", "song3", "song4", "song5".
3) Kindly make sure that you have set up your tailwind as I have used Tailwind CSS.
4) Just enjoy the songs.
